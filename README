		Adding a reverse thread mode where client can request 
		the server to send data to the client (-E, --reverse) and 
		a NAT travelsal flag that makes the server to reuse 
		the incoming socket for downlink testing (-2, --nat).

  iperf -c foo.bar.edu [-L port] -r  (run trade-off test using separate sockets (local port to receive is -L port or -p port or default port))
  iperf -c foo.bar.edu -2 -r         (run trade-off test over the client initiated socket)
  iperf -c foo.bar.edu [-L port] -E  (ask server to do downlink test only over separate socket (local port to receive is -L port or -p port or default port)
  iperf -c foo.bar.edu -2 -E         (ask server to do downlink test over the client initiated socket)
